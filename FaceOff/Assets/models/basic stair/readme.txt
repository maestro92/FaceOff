A basic metallic stair 3D model

Hi,

this is a basic 3D model of a stair which can be use for static rendering as well as games (mainly FPS
or similar kind of game). A simple texture, a bump mapping texture and a template in Gimp format are included.

Hope you'll like it.

Feel free to use it as you wish, modify it, or anything, just don't forget to give credit.
