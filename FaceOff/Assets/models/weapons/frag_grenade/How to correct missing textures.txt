In your material editor/manager, find the material that you need to fix, and load the picture into that spot. For example, if you load the 
file and the seat texture is missing, open the Seat material, and load the color and bump pictures into the correct spots. They would be
names Seat_C (seat color) and Seat_B (seat Bump) or something obvious.

C for Color
B for Bump
R for Reflection
S for Specularity
T for Transparency
D for Diffuse
N for Normal
