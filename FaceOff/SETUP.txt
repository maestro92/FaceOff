- if you see the following error 
"
error C4996: 'gets': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using gets_s instead. 
To disable deprecation, use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS. See online help for details.

Visual Studio (VS) compiler gives this error. It's simple to get rid of this problem.

1. Go to your VS context menu Project > Properties.
2. Click Configuration > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor.
3. Edit Preprocessor Definitions and add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS last empty line.

This compile warning will be gone.

- If you see this other error
"
error C4996: 'inet_ntoa': Use inet_ntop() or InetNtop() instead or define _WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS to disable deprecated API warnings

""

Follow the steps above and add "_WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS" in the Preprocessor Definitions

-	difference between namespace-functions vs static methods on a class

essentially, when I was making the utility functions, my first approach is just to have a class full of static functions. Then later on, I switched to namespace

short answer:
By default, use namespaced functions.
Classes are to build objects, not to replace namespaces.

-	should i specify virtual on the sub-classes methods as well

No you technically do not need to specify virtual. If the base method is virtual then C++ will automatically make the matching override method virtual.
However you should be marking them virtual. The method is virtual after all and it makes your code much clearer and easier to follow by other developers.
